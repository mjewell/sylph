# Sylph

This is a tiny but full-featured bootstrapper/loader for single-page
applications. It is configured using meta tags in your
HTML document's `head` section.

To use it, simply load it using a `script` tag on your
index page and specifying the DOM element that Sylph's UI (and your
own application) will occupy by specifying a `sylph-target` meta.

```html
<head>
  <link href="/public/sylph.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
  <meta name="sylph-target" content="#root" />
</head>
<body>
  <div id="#root">
    <script src="/public/sylph.js" />
  </div>
</body>
```

The following configuration tags let you change Sylph's behavior.

description
: App name displayed while loading.

author
: Creator/copyright info displayed while loading.

sylph-target
: CSS selector that Sylph UI (and your app) will be loaded in; defaults to `body`.

sylph-root
: Absolute or relative base URL for application files; defaults to `window.location.host`.

sylph-base
: Base path under application root; defaults to `/`.

sylph-files
: Comma-separated list of subpaths (relative to base) to CSS and script files; defaults to `main.js`.

sylph-debug
: Enable debug logging if present (regardless of content).

To make developers happier, root and bases can be customized using query-string
patterns of your choosing. To let people experiment with local or pre-production
UIs, you might:

```html
<meta name="sylph-xf-query-base" content="ui=>alt/*" />
<meta name="sylph-xf-query-root" content="ui.local=>http://localhost:8080" />
```

This allows your developers to load `https://example.org?ui=foo` in order
to experiment with the version of the app that is published under the
`foo/` prefix of your root. If you need two files, `app.js` and `app.css`,
both will be loaded relative to this alternative base. Or, they can
use `https://example.org?ui.local` to run with a local dev-mode UI!

If specified in the query string, root and base entirely replace the
defaults specified in HTML metadata.

Finally, Sylph can append a query string to the href of every
asset it loads, conditional on the root from which they are being
loaded. This allows special instructions to be sent to development
servers. To ensure that hot reloading works when running with a
`webpack-dev-server` on port 8081 and a remote server, you might:

```html
<meta name="sylph-xf-root-asset-query" content="127.0.0.1=>sockPort=8081>
```

## Get started

Start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
You will briefly see a spinner, then the screen will turn black because
the dummy app has been loaded.

Edit index.html and change the root or files to refer to something
nonexistent; notice that Sylph displays an error. Use dev tools to
slow down the network; notice that Sylph displays a splash screen
with a spinner.
